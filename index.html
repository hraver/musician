                <p class="centxt">The 1969 concert in Woodstock was, reportedly not the best show that the Grateful Dead had put on, there was a lot of rain and ensuing technical problems. It has been said that this was the start of the Dead's psychedelic music. Notwishstanding, the music always had roots in country, folk, blues, etc.</p></div>
